# Indoor positioning based on Wifi-fingerprinting

Many real world applications need to know the localization of an user in 
the world to provide their services. However, indoor localization is still 
an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments.
<br>
Some technologies used for indoor positioning are:

- Bluetooth
- IR
- Magnetic fields
- Ultra sonic
- Wifi fingerprinting

WiFi based positioning doesn't require additional hardware infrastructure.

The objectives of this project are:

- Investigate the feasibility of using "wifi fingerprinting" to determine 
a person's location in indoor spaces.
- Evaluate multiple machine learning models to see which produces the best 
result.
